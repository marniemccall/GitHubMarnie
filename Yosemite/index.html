					<h1 class="special">Completely new. Completely Mac.</h1>
					<p>With OS X Yosemite, we set out to elevate the experience of using a Mac. To do that, we looked at the entire system and refined it app by app. Feature by feature. Pixel by pixel. And we built great new capabilities into the interface that put need-to-know information at your fingertips. The result is that your Mac has a fresh new look, with all the power and simplicity you know and love.<span><a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/osx/preview/design/">Learn more.</a></span></p>
